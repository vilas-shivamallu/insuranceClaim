# Progressive Insurance – Claim system 

(slightly modified from the original) 

 

In order to increase customer satisfaction, Progressive Auto Insurance Company simplified its car insurance claim process significantly, by doing 3 things: 

Establishing a call centre 

Deploying a large number of field officers in the city 

By empowering them to make immediate compensation payments to the customer, and  

By deploying a system which can be accessed via smart phone app. 

 

The process is as follows:  

 

When a customer calls the call centre regarding an accident, the call centre person registers a ‘Case’ in the system, capturing details such as location of accident, nature of accident, etc. (The system already has policy details). The system then displays the Case # of the newly created case. 

 

The call centre person then identifies a field officer whose current location is nearest to that of the accident and assigns him the case. The system then sends a notification message to the app in field officer’s smart phone. The central system knows the location of each field officer because the mobile app installed in the field officer’s phone, regularly updates its location to the central system. 

 

The field officer then reaches the accident spot and examines the damage to the car. He calculates the compensation to be paid, using the app on his mobile phone. The app calculates the amount based on the coverage mentioned in the insurance policy which is retrieved from the central system. 

 

If the compensation amount is less than Rs. 10,000, then the field officer transfers the amount to the customer using the app. In order to transfer the amount, the app requests the central system by providing customer id and the amount. The central system determines the account # from the application database and sends a fund transfer request to the payment gateway.  

 

If the compensation amount is greater than Rs. 10,000, the field officer sends the case to his insurance officer for approval (via the smart phone app). The insurance officer either approves the amount or modifies the amount. He then transfers the amount to the customer’s bank account in a similar manner.
